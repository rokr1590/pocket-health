# pocket_health

A new Flutter application.

## Inspiration
Being a college student, we observed that mental health is something which is completely ignored by the society and which may cause serious health issues for students. So here we are with a solution which will help everyone to take care of their mental health virtually.
## What it does
In this application, we conduct a survey and calculate the PSS(Perceived Stress Scale) which predicts the stress level of the person, where 10 is Stress free and 1 being highly stressed. Accordingly, we suggested activities to user which will help them relieve their stress. There are different activities such as Meditating, listening to music etc
## How we built it
First of all we designed the UI of the app using Figma. To built this application we used Flutter and dart environment.
## Challenges we ran into
We were using many widgets for the first time such as NavigationBar, FireBase Authentication, FlutterRingtone, SurveyKit etc which took lot of debugging to get it working.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Even tough after facing lot of obstacles, we managed to built the working prototype of the project which we are proud of.
## What we learned
We got to learn many new widgets as well as tackling unusual problems in code. Most importantly we learned teamwork.
## What's next for Pocket Health
Next part we will be focusing on adding more new activities and surveys also there is space for improvement in UI of the app.
